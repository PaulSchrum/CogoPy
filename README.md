# CogoPy
Open source Cogo (Coordinate Geometry).  Written in Python.

Cogo is the industry name for the alignments used to define highway or railway alignments.  
They are sometimes called Center Lines, but they aren't always right in the center.

For horizontal control there are Horizontal Alignments and consist of chains of line segments, 
arc segments, and Euler Spiral segements, almost always continuous in Azimuth.

For vertical control there are Vertical Alignments, chains of line segments (constant slope) and 
vertical curves: parabolas used to change slope smoothly.

Since it is open source, I am interested in having collaborators.
