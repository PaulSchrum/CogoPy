BestFit is starting its life out as a course project for GIS 540 (at NC State).  Because
of this, there will be some code smells that are due to constraints imposed by an
introductory programming course.  These code smells will factored out after the course
project has been submitted.

BestFit takes an ordered list of 2D points and computes a fairly good fit Cogo Horizontal
Alignment.  Maybe it should have been called FairFit or NoneTooShabbyFit.  But it's not.

The coordinate domain is assumed to be planar.  If you are using lat/long, it is
recommended that you project it to a plane.
